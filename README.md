# Module-5-Challenge

Used previous coursework assignments, in class student and instructor demos to help write code for this assignment. Also utilized shared code from classmate from Slack to help filter out duplicate mouse from 249 to 248. Also utiltized matplotlib documentation https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/basic/scatter_plot.html#sphx-glr-plot-types-basic-scatter-plot-py to help write code for graphs. Additionally, referenced pandas documentation for several functions and code writing: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/basics.html.
